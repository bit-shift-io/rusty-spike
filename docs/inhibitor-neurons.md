# Inhibitor Neurons

So far I have lateral inhibition, but I want to add more types of inhibitor neurons.
To do these, I suspect I will need an alternate set of weights and neurons which are just for inhibition.

## Types of Inhibitor Neurons

### 1. Lateral Inhibition

Lateral inhibition is a type of inhibition that occurs between neurons that are located next to each other. It is a type of inhibition that is used to enhance the contrast between the activity of different neurons. Lateral inhibition is a key component of the nervous system and plays an important role in regulating the activity of other neurons. 

### 2. Feedforward Inhibition

### 3. Feedback Inhibition

### 4. Reciprocal Inhibition

### 5. Lateral Inhibition

### 6. Recurrent Inhibition
